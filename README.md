# openfunnel
OpenFunnel is a concept for a sales funnel that can be self-hosted and thus owned by the host 100%. Instead of being overly complicated with many moving parts, it will consist of a website, a CRM on the backend, and a basic CMS with site-builder tools that make it easier than ever to own your business while converting contacts into clients.

Roadmap:
- Develop initial sales funnel as proof of concept
- Decide on stack to use (considering ReactJS with Firebase or Supabase)
- Develop CRM with customizable fields to fit requirements of owner
- Develop CMS for easy content updates on frontend and creation of new pages
- Create admin panel for backend of site
- Genericize template to use replicable components
- Implement customization features to update theme on frontend in a way that's simple for common users
